== Welcome to openmoney-server

Quick Start    
	This quick-start is intended for developers and early adopters who want to get started running an open money client/server.

	Step 1: Install Prerequisites
		Ruby
		Database: You can use any database that Rails supports. We’ve been developing on MySQL 5
		Rails
		Git

	Step 2: Install openmoney-server
		Clone the git repository with:
		git clone git://github.com/openmoney/openmoney-server.git

		Then do the standard rails set-up actions, i.e.
		create a database “omserver_development” (this will vary depending on which database you chose)
		cd config
		cp database_example.yml database_yml
		edit config/database.yml with the database passwords and and setup according to which database you chose.

		Once you have set up the database then you can:
		rake db:migrate
		ruby script/server -p 3001

	Step 3: Try it out!
		You should now have the server running an accessible at: localhost:3001
