== Welcome to rubyom

Quick Start    
	This quick-start is intended for developers and early adopters who want to get started running an open money client.

	Step 1: Install Prerequisites
		Ruby
		Database: You can use any database that Rails supports. We’ve been developing on MySQL 5
		Rails
		Subversion

	Step 2: Install rubyom
		Do an svn install from rubyforge with:
		svn checkout http://openmoney.rubyforge.org/svn/rubyom/trunk rubyom

		Then do the standard rails set-up actions, i.e.
		create a database “rubyom_development” (this will vary depending on which database you chose)
		edit config/database.yml with the database passwords and and setup according to which database you chose.

		Once you have set up the database then you can:
		cd rubyom
		rake db:migrate
		ruby script/server -p 3001

	Step 3: Try it out!
		You should now have the client running an accessible at: localhost:3000
